Gravity thrusters for fast interstellar travel

The gravitational engines of their ships operate on the principle of acceleration of gravitons in a plasma field. 
Gravitons are best made from tetravalent elements such as carbon and silicon.

The plasma field does not allow gravitons knocked out of matter to leave the engine, they begin to rotate along its internal contour, 
quickly picking up speed above the speed of light.

The pilot will only have to choose the direction of flight and the distance, after which there will be an instant movement to the selected point.

Before you turn on the gravitational engine, you need to limit the influence of the planet's gravity, 
on special engines that work on the principle of repulsion from magnetic fields.

Six kilograms of carbon in the form of finely ground graphite must be placed in the graviton chamber 
(this amount is enough to move 30 light years if the mass of the ship with all its contents is no more than 700 kg).

A deep vacuum must be created in the graviton chamber and the internal circuit of the engine. To create a plasma field, 
70% hydrogen and 30% helium must be sent to the plasma generator.

In the plasma generator itself, the smallest particles of calcium and sodium must be sprayed, 
for the stability of the plasma field and its better controllability. The more these metals are purified, the more stable the field.

Turn on the power plant and heat hydrogen and helium to a temperature of 7000 degrees Kelvin, under a pressure of 15 Earth atmospheres.

If a plasma field occurs, direct it to the graviton chamber without violating the tightness of the latter. 
Change the intensity of the plasma field until the device shows the beginning of the release of gravitons from carbon. 
When gravitons are knocked out of matter, they will rotate along the internal contour of the engine, quickly picking up speed.

The plasma field will not allow them to leave the engine or return back to the substance. 
When the speed of gravitons reaches four light speeds, the accumulated energy will instantly transfer the ship to a pre-selected point in space, 
after which the gravitons will return to the substance, but it will be unsuitable for re-displacement.

You can turn on the gravitational engine only in space, at a distance of at least 80 thousand kilometers from large gravitational masses, 
otherwise the movement will be impossible or will happen to another place, uncontrollable for the pilot. 
This is due to the fact that strong gravitational fields disrupt the operation of the engine, 
slowing down the acceleration of gravitons and slowing down their release.

The plasma generator and the gravitational chamber are made of BODAR alloy.
