Model_4 is under experimental development and production of a series of prototypes.
The model is a gyroscope with seven rotation planes. 
Now it is clear that the model can generate the electricity we are used to, 
freely hang in the space of the planet's magnetic fields, stabilize the existing models in flight, 
and also generate active fields that have not yet been studied. 
Conventionally, the model is classified as magnetic, although it may not be.
The model is inaccurate. For more information, please contact the chat site http://lab7.site
