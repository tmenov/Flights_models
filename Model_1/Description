Atmospheric vortex models.
Vortex model of vertical take-off and landing without external moving parts.
The model is capable of moving at speeds of Mach 5-7 (6125 - 8575 km / h).

Model_1 is a dense vortex generator.
The property of a mixture of gases (air), when twisting into a vortex and at a sufficient flow rate, to form a dense, 
stable substance, capable of holding significant loads (depending on the flow rate and the coefficient of twisting), 
has been noticed. The atmospheric Model_1 is built on this simple principle, 
capable of moving at significant speeds in various gas mixtures and at the same time showing extraordinary stability and control flexibility.

The production of this model is incredibly cheap. Its operation is easy and accessible to anyone who has learned how to manage the existing auto transport. 
Devices of this class are unbelievably reliable as they have a minimum of moving parts.
The use of such devices will allow earthlings to live in more acceptable conditions far beyond the aisles of existing cities, 
for example, in the mountains, because the road to the office 1500 kilometers from home will take no more than 15 minutes.
