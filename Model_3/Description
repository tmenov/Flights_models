Atmospheric magnetic models
Compact, backpack model of vertical take-off and landing, designed to move a pilot or a pilot with a load at speeds up to 300 km / h 
since the model does not have a cockpit.

This flying device of a new (for earthlings) type is intended to replace the existing means of locomotion. Model_1 is a dense vortex generator based on magnetic fields.

The production of this model is incredibly cheap. Its operation is easy and accessible to anyone who has learned to ride a bicycle. Devices of this class are unbelievably reliable as they have a minimum of moving parts.
The use of such devices will allow earthlings to move within existing cities without traffic hindrances and will make it possible to automatically send small loads over short distances.
