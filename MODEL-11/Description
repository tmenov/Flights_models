The general principle of operation of intra-atmospheric and planetary engines. Onboard power plant

The principle of operation of the intraatmospheric engine is based on interaction with the gravitational fields of the planets. 
A special anti-gravitational-electro-magnetic field is created, which "shields" part of the ship from the planet's gravity or changes the direction and 
strength of the gravitational field, thanks to which the ship can move in any direction, sharply changing direction and speed.

In this case, a protective plasma field is usually created around the ship, inside which a constant level of gravity is maintained. 
Thanks to this, those who fly in a UFO do not have overloads, and they do not deviate in different directions from sharp turns. 
The protective plasma field appears as a white to red ball, depending on the amount of energy directed by the pilot to create it.

The planetary drive creates a magnetic field around the ship, attracting it to the desired planet. 
The stronger this field, the faster the ship will fly. Its maximum speed is 1/8 of the speed of light.

The planetary drive is used near planets and is based on the principle of attraction or repulsion from the magnetic fields of the planet.
It consists of plates rotating in different planes, consisting of an alloy of the two main components Tellurium and Palladium (Fakep alloy), 
these elements contain energies in such forms and vibrations that can, using the energy coming from the engine, 
capture radiation coming from the planet and repel or be attracted to them. (SEE MODEL-4 VERSION-3 GYRO IN 5 PLANES).
The mass of the ship is approximately 1200 kg, the speed is 1/8 of the speed of light.
Also, the FAKEP alloy is applicable in MODEL-6 VERSION-7.

In the power plant and in planetary engines there are FIKEP plates and alloys that convert cosmic radiation into electricity, 
visible light and a magnetic component.

Cosmic radiation enters from the "antenna" on top of the "dish" into the converter, 
in which these plates rotate rapidly to achieve a larger area of contact with cosmic radiation, due to which electricity, 
light and a component of magnetic energy are released, which sets the device in motion.

The data is provided in full compliance with the Law on Security and Violations (an analogue of the criminal code) of the planet Burkhad for 
the planet Earth (Gaia) as a colony of the planet Burkhad within the framework of 
the program Growth in the Level of Spirituality Through Technical Progress and Discoveries approved by the council of the planet Burkhad.
